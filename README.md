# Quick Start JS

| An ArcGIS Javscript library and samples to help you build web mapping applications quickly.  The library simplifies a number of basic tasks such as loading and centering basemaps, and provides higher-level calls to a number of ArcGIS Online services such as geocoding and routing.  No dojo or GIS knowledge required.  Bootstrap is used to layout and style the applications. | ![App](http://edn1.esri.com/quickstartjs/snapshot.png) |
